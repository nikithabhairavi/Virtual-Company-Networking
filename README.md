 Project Title: Virtual-Company-Networking

Project Overview:
This project simulates the networking infrastructure of a small company using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It aims to design and implement a secure, scalable, and functional network that can support various business operations. The network includes essential components such as routers, switches, firewalls, workstations, and wireless access points, creating a complete virtualized network environment for the company.

 Features:
- Multi-layered Network Design: Includes routers, switches, and firewalls to ensure security and segmentation.
- VLAN Configuration: Segmentation of the network into different Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to improve performance and security.
- Dynamic Routing Protocols: Implementation of RIP and OSPF for efficient routing and network scalability.
- DHCP and DNS Services: Configuration of DHCP for automatic IP address assignment and DNS for name resolution.
- Wireless Networking: Setup of wireless access points to provide connectivity for mobile devices.
- Network Security: Basic firewall and NAT configurations to secure internal network resources from external threats.
- Redundancy and Fault Tolerance: Implementation of redundancy protocols to minimize downtime and ensure network reliability.

 Objective:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a small business can build an efficient and reliable network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed to be scalable, secure, and capable of handling the essential tasks of a modern company, such as file sharing, communication, and internet access.

Technologies Used:
- Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation
- Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF
- VLANs for network segmentation
- DHCP and DNS for automated services
- NAT and Firewall configurations for security
- Wireless Network for mobile and remote access
 Folder Structure:
- Network_Topology: Contains the complete network diagram and configurations.
- Config_Files: Includes configuration files for routers, switches, and firewalls.
- Documentation: Detailed step-by-step instructions on setting up the network and troubleshooting common issues.

How to Use:
1. Open the Cisco Packet Tracer file included in this repository.
2. Review the network topology and configurations.
3. Modify the network components as needed to adapt to different use cases.
4. Use the configuration files to apply the network setup to your own Cisco Packet Tracer environment.
